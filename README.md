# ValanceExecutor
A roblox level 7 executor! Designed by me the ui looks weird dont worry about it also virus free 

# Details

Api used : WeAreDevs_Api.dll
EasyExploits never worked for me so idk why so i used wearedevs (even though their executor downloads and api are sketchy as hell)
Also you can decompile it and find no malware other then 
the api and the fast colored text box because i wouldn't be an idiot and put malware on github like who does that?
